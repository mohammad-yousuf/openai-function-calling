# openai-function-calling
A tutorial on the new OpenAI ChatGPT/GPT-4 function calling, which bridges the gap between deterministic and non-deterministic programming - leading to all sorts of possibilities

## This tutorial contains 3 parts:
 - extracting information from text in a structured format using a function
 - extracting multiple types of information in a structured format using a function with multiple arguments
 - Writing SQL queries in ChatGPT using a function, and using this as a higher-level abstraction on top of SQL
